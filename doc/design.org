* Docscan Design Document

** Purpose

Docscan should help me save all my scanned documents to PDF. So far I
was using Photoshop:
- Load the scanned image
- Crop and perhaps color-enhance
- Save to PDF (choose the correct quality preset and give a name)
- Repeat for each one

I would like it to be faster and work for multiple documents at once
